============================================================

HIGH DOCUMENT FREQUENCY TERMS:
------------------------------------------------------------
Terms: the, of, in, a, and, to, for, said, on, that

Characteristics:
1. These are typically common words (stop words) like 'the', 'a', 'and', etc.
2. They appear in a very large proportion of documents (often 50-90%+).
3. They have low discriminative power - they don't help distinguish between documents.
4. They are usually short, common function words or very general content words.
5. In information retrieval, these terms are often removed or down-weighted.

LOW DOCUMENT FREQUENCY TERMS:
------------------------------------------------------------
Terms: memphia, platinumsellers, platinumhaired, conomination, fiverecord, specifially, indescretion, phofo, whitewigged, metroiii

Characteristics:
1. These are rare or specialized terms that appear in very few documents.
2. They have high discriminative power - they are good at identifying specific documents.
3. They often represent:
   - Proper nouns (names, places, organizations)
   - Technical terms or jargon
   - Rare concepts or specialized vocabulary
   - Typos or unusual spellings
4. They are useful for precision in search (finding very specific documents).
5. However, they may have low recall if used alone in queries.

KEY DIFFERENCES:
------------------------------------------------------------
• Discriminative Power: Low-DF terms are highly discriminative; High-DF terms are not.
• Use in IR: Low-DF terms are good for precision; High-DF terms are often filtered.
• Vocabulary: High-DF terms are common/general; Low-DF terms are specific/rare.
